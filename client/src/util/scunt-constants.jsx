  <h2>The H!unt</h2>
  <h3>What is S!cavenger H!unt?</h3>
  <p>
    The H!unt is the best part of F!rosh Week (we promise we aren’t biased)! It’s a chaos filled event where you and your team compete against other F!rosh to get as many points as you possibly can. Your team gains points by completing <a href='/scunt-missions'>missions</a> and getting them judged by our super judgy judges (judging stations are located in the Pit). The top three teams mayyyy also get something special on top of well-deserved bragging rights ;)
